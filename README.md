# JNetSend - README

**JNetSend** is an app created back in 2002 with the intent to provide a *pretty* interface for chat via `net send` (command line) in a WinNT based network.

The goal back then was replace a Visual Basic version of a similar app in the company where I did my internship.

**Note**: the code is poorly commented and a *little* messy :-)

## Requirements
 * JRE 1.4 or later
 * Ant 1.7 or later (`build.xml` was generated by Eclipse recently)
 * Works only in Windows workstations in WinNT network since it depends on `net send` service.

## Usage
```cmd
> cd <installation folder>
> java -jar JNetSend.jar
```
